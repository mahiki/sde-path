####Testing the markdown idea

Its actually pretty good :-).

But what I really want is to see either the code or the final result not both.  Onenote is lame because of all the non-matching *stuff*, if you know what I mean.

Best case is sublime text - showing the markdown view for .md documents.  Then I can search everything, and keep all my notes in folders for organization like the OneNote notebooks, and file heading leaders to classify topic areas.  `Notebook/heading|file.` vs `Folder/topic|file` or `Folder/folder/file`.

One of the last two is the good solution:
`Folder/topic|file`
`Folder/topic/file`

nested folders aren't tough to browse in sublime text.

Now is the time to show [links](www.ycombinator/hackernews.com).  Yoop it works.

**Bold Flavor!**

##OK I like this - get sublime package and use Markdown from here out
