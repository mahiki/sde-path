### meta-repo notes
all the items in issues are cool things to do.  
some of the issues refer to other repos.  
this repo is a workspace for almost anything, a tuturial or short book review will be in a folder.   
organization is not a requirement, this is a place to get some comfort level and familiarity with new concepts.  

here are some of the most exciting issues and repos:
