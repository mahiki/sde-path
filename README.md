### meta-repo notes
*this repo is a workspace for almost anything, a tuturial or short book review will be in a folder*

**julia** is my primary language -- keep that in a separate repo.
awk-sed repo for awk and sed
all the items in issues are cool things to do.  
some of the issues refer to other repos, trying to resolve those.
organization is not a requirement, this is a place to get some comfort level and familiarity with new concepts.  

here are some of the most exciting issues and repos:
